\section{Support request}

To answer our question we have performed RNA-seq, total RNA ribosomal RNA depleted. We had 4 groups and would like help to finding differentially expressed genees


%% MATERIALS AND METHODS SECTION
\section{Materials and Methods}
\subsection{Available data}
Data were delivered to Inbox on Uppnex {\noUppmax} in fastq format using Illumina 1.8 quality scores. Data were from a paired-end run, with one file for the forward reads and one file for the reverse reads following a naming convention: [LANE\_[DATE]\_[FLOWCELL]\_[SCILIFE NAME]\_[READ].fastq.gz. 

\subsection{Data processing}
Raw sequencing reads were processed to obtain counts per genes for each samples. This included: 
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\fastqc} quality check on raw sequencing reads
  \item {\trimmomatic} reads filtering for quality score and read length. Reads with average quality below 20 (within 4-base wide sliding window) and/or shorter than 36 bases were removed
  \item {\star} was used to align the reads to the reference genome {\refGenome} using the annotation {\refAnnotation}, with reference genome and annotation downloaded from {\refSource}
  \item {\featureCounts} from {\subread} was used to count the fragments in the exon regions as defined in the {\refAnnotation} file, using default parameters. Specifically, for paired-end reads, a fragment is said to overlap a feature if at least one read base is found to overlap the feature. Fragments overlapping with more than one feature and multi-mapping reads are not counted
  \item Counts from multiple lanes were added, if applicable
  \item {\samtools} were used to sort and index the BAM files containing the aligned reads, e.g. for visualisation in \href{https://www.broadinstitute.org/igv/}{IGV} genome browser 
  \item {\multiqc} was used to aggregate results from {\fastqc}, {\star} and {\featureCounts} across many samples into a single report
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Differential expression}
All analyses were performed under \texttt{R}, a programming language and software environment for statistical computing and graphics. Details on the \texttt{R} version and packages used can found at the end of this document in \nameref{sessionInfo}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{biomaRt} package was used to annotate Ensembl gene identifiers with chromosome name, official gene symbol and description. 
  \item low count reads were filtered by keeping reads with at least 1 read per million in at least 2 samples
  \item \texttt{edgeR} package was used to normalise for the RNA composition by finding a set of scaling factors for the library sizes that minimize the log-fold changes between the samples for most genes, using a trimmed mean of M values (TMM) between each pair of samples.
  \item the normalized counts were used to examine the samples for outliers and relationships, using Multidimensional Scaling and heatmap based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between every sample pair
    \item the normalized counts were used to examine the samples for outliers and relationships, using Multidimensional Scaling and heatmap based on the Pearson correlation coefficient between every sample pair
    \item \texttt{edgeR} package was to define design matrix based on the experimental design, fitting gene-wise glms model and conducting likelihood ratio tests for the selected group comparisons
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Exon usage}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \texttt{DEXseq} package in \texttt{R} was used to infer differential exon usage
  \item the provided with the \texttt{DEXseq} package \texttt{Python} scripts were used to prepare a flattened GTF file based on the {\refAnnotation} and to obtain counts per each exon given the aligned BAM files
  \item size factors measuring the relative sequencing depth were estimated to adjust for coverage biases
  \item variability of the data was then estimated to be able to distinguish technical and biological variation from real effects on exon usage due to the different conditions. Briefly, per-exon dispersions are calculated using a Cox-Reid adjusted profile likelihood estimation, then a dispersion-mean relation is fitted to this individual dispersion values and finally, the fitted values are taken as a prior in order to shrink the per-exon estimates towards the fitted values
  \item having the dispersion estimates and the size factors, differential exon usage was tested. For each gene, \texttt{DEXSeq} fits a generalized linear model with the formula \( \sim samples + exon + condition:exon\) and compares it to the null model  \( \sim samples + exon\). The deviances of both fits are compared using a $\chi^2$-distribution, giving rise to a p value, indicative wether the null model is sufficient to explain the data or whether it may be rejected in favour of the alternative containing an interaction coefficient for condition$\colon$exon. The latter means that the fraction of the gene's reads that fall onto the exon under the test differs significantly between the experimental conditions.
  \item the obtained p-values were BH adjusted for multiple comparison
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{HOMER Motif Analysis}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item {\homer} was used to analyze the promoters of genes and look for motifs that are enriched in the target gene promoters relative to other pomoters. The analyses followed the \href{http://homer.salk.edu/homer/motif/index.html}{'Analyzing lists of genes with promoter motif analysis' tutorial}
  \item briefly, for each comparison, the analyses were run for the differentially expressed genes, separately for down- and up-regulated genes, were differentially expressed genes were defined at 5\% FDR and absolute minimum log 2 fold change of 1. 
  \item the analyses included Gene Ontology enrichment calculations, \textit{de novo} motif analysis and known motif enrichment analysis
\end{enumerate}

\section{Important practical information}
\subsection{Data responsibility}
Unfortunately, we do not have resources to keep any files associated with the support request. We kindly suggest that you store safely the results delivered by us. In addition, we kindly ask that you remove the files from UPPMAX/UPPNEX {\noUppmax}. The main storage at UPPNEX is optimized for high-speed and parallell access, which makes it expensive and not the right place for longer time archiving. Please consider others by not taking up the expensive space.
\subsection{Acknowledgments}
If you are presenting the results in a paper, at a workshop or conference, we kindly ask you to acknowledge us.

\section{Results}
\subsection{Data exploration}
Table count, containing counts measured across many genes and samples, is a typical example of a multidimensional dataset, where \textit{N} objects (samples) were measured on \textit{p} numeric variables. Hence, to examine the samples for outliers and other relationship one can look at the several multivariate techniques that aim to reduce the dataset dimensions and to reveal the data structure by plotting samples in one or two dimensions. Multidimensional Scaling provides a visual representation of the pattern of proximities among a set of objects, here samples. Another method of visualisation is a heatmap based on the Pearson correlation coefficient, calculated between every sample pair.

\subsubsection{Estimating BCVs}
Two levels of variation, technical and biological, can be distinguished in any RNA-Seq experiment. Biological coefficient of variation (BCV) is the coefficient of variation with which the (unknown) true abundance of the gene varies between replicate RNA samples. It represents the CV that would remain between biological replicates if sequencing depth could be increased indefinitely. The technical CV decreases as the size of the counts increases. BCV on the other hand does not. BCV is therefore likely to be the dominant source of uncertainty for high-count genes, so reliable estimation of BCV is crucial for realistic assessment of differential expression in RNA-Seq experiments. \texttt{edgeR} uses empirical Bayes methods that permit the estimation of gene-specific biological variation, even for experiments with minimal levels of biological replication.

\section{Where to go next}
There is a wide selection of online user-friendly tools available for investigating the interesting genes or list of DE genes. Few recommended below 
\begin{description}
  \item[\href{hhttp://biit.cs.ut.ee/clustvis/}{ClustVist}] for creating Principal Component Analysis plots and heatmaps
  \item[\href{http://bioinfogp.cnb.csic.es/tools/venny/}{Venny}] helps to prepare Venn diagram showing relations between a finite collection of different sets, e.g. between list of DE genes from different comparisons
  \item[\href{https://david.ncifcrf.gov}{DAVID}] for a comprehensive set of functional annotation tools for investigators to understand biological meaning behind large list of genes, including identification of enriched Gene Ontology terms, discovering enriched functional-related gene groups, visualizing genes on BioCarta \& KEGG pathway and many more
  \item[\href{http://revigo.irb.hr}{REVIGO}] for summarizing long list of Gene Ontology terms and visualisation in semantic similarity-based scatterplots, interactive graphs or tag clouds
  \item[\href{http://funcoup.sbc.su.se/}{FunCoup}] for inferring genome-wide functional couplings or associations, that is an unspecific form of association that encompasses direct physical interaction but also more general types of direct or indirect interaction like regulatory interaction or participation the same process or pathway.
